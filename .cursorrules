# Shadcn Instructions

You are working inside a project that uses **Shadcn UI**.

When generating UI components, always assume the latest Shadcn setup and follow this format to add new components:

```bash
pnpx shadcn@latest add <component-name>
```

Example for installing the Button component:

```bash
pnpx shadcn@latest add button
```

## Commit Message Format (Use for future commits)

Use conventional commit style for clarity and maintainability:

| Type | When to Use |
|------|-------------|
| **feat:** | Add a new feature or page |
| **fix:** | Bug fixes |
| **ui:** | UI enhancements or styling changes |
| **refactor:** | Code improvements without feature change |
| **chore:** | Config, setup, dependency updates |
| **docs:** | README or documentation changes |
| **style:** | Formatting, naming, code style only |

### Examples

```bash
feat: add expense form UI
feat: implement localStorage CRUD for transactions
ui: improve table layout with Shadcn components
refactor: extract reusable form input component
docs: update README with installation steps
```

### Additional Guidelines

- Always prefer Shadcn components for UI instead of plain HTML or other libraries.
- All code should be written in TypeScript.
- Prioritize accessibility, clean structure, and component reusability.
- Use feature-specific commit messages to maintain clean history.
- When in doubt, refer to the official Shadcn documentation for best practices.
